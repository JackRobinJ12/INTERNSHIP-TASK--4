**DESCRIPTION** :
The RecommenderSystem program is a user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system built using Apache Mahout. It reads user-item interaction data from a CSV file (dataset.csv) and recommends items based on user similarities. The FileDataModel class loads the dataset, where each row represents a user-item rating. The Pearson Correlation Similarity metric is used to compute the similarity between users. The NearestNUserNeighborhood method finds the two most similar users to a given user. Using this information, the GenericUserBasedRecommender generates personalized recommendations for a user (in this case, user ID 1). Finally, the system outputs the top three recommended items along with their relevance scores. This program demonstrates a fundamental approach to recommendation systems and can be extended for real-world applications by incorporating larger datasets and additional filtering techniques.
